Mosaix
======
A XNA library for rendering tile-based maps.

__Not yet recommended for public use!!__

Description
-----------
Mosaix is a wrapper from TiledSharp to XNA which loads contents into the XNA
content manager and provides subroutines for drawing tile maps.

At the moment, it is not anything particuarly special.


Design goals
------------
- Translate TiledSharp objects into more optimised data formats.
- Pre-render any bounding rectangles (done)
- Only render tiles within window
- Repeating tiles as single Draw()?
